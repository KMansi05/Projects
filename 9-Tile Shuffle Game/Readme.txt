The 9-Tile Shuffle Game is inspired by classic sliding tile puzzles, offering a simple yet engaging experience that tests playersâ€™ problem-solving skills. The game consists of 8 numbered tiles and one empty space within a 3x3 grid. Players can slide adjacent tiles into the empty space to reorganize the grid. This project serves as an excellent practice for learning and applying C++ concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.



Objectives:

1. Develop an interactive and visually clear sliding tile game using C++.
2. Provide an intuitive interface for players to move tiles.
3. Incorporate logic to verify the completion of the puzzle.
4. Enhance problem-solving skills by implementing efficient algorithms to manage tile movements and validations.



Features:

1. Dynamic Game Board: A 3x3 grid initialized with randomized tile arrangements ensuring a solvable puzzle.
2. Tile Movement: Players can move a tile into the empty space using keyboard inputs (e.g., W, A, S, D).
3. Completion Detection: The program validates the arrangement to determine if the player has solved the puzzle.
4. Moves Counter: Tracks the number of moves the player makes.
5. Restart Option: Allows the player to restart the game with a new puzzle.



Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: C++
Development Environment: Turbo C++/Visual Studio
Algorithms Used:
1. Randomization algorithm to shuffle tiles while ensuring solvability.
2. Logic for detecting valid moves and updating the grid state.
3. Data Structure: The 3x3 grid is represented as a 2D array.
4. User Input: Players interact with the game using keyboard inputs to move tiles.
